# JavaToCS_Test
Just a folder where i test thing to convert from java to c#

## c0.0.13a
https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Classic_0.0.13a

it's a conversion of the java code to c# using opentk as graphics.
it helped me understand the process for converting code from Java to C# and from lwjgl to OpenTK

the conversion is very broken because I'm too lazy to fix the last things like: the textures of the blocks and particles are broken, the mob doesn't spawn or doesn't render it idk, the timer is broken and other things

### why 0.0.13a? 
idk i like it lol,
also because I had already modded it before so I was already familiar with the code

### how to compile

I don't know why you would want to compile this abomination... but anyway, enjoy

* Clone the project
* in the terminal do ``dotnet run``
for any problem ask in the discord server
